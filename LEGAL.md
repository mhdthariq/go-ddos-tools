## ⚠️ Common Misconceptions

### Myth 1: "I'm helping them by finding vulnerabilities"
**Reality**: Unauthorized testing is illegal, even with good intentions. Always get permission first.

### Myth 2: "It's just a test, I won't cause real damage"
**Reality**: Even unsuccessful attacks are illegal. Intent and capability matter, not just results.

### Myth 3: "I'm anonymous, they can't trace me"
**Reality**: Law enforcement has sophisticated tracing capabilities. VPNs and Tor are not foolproof.

### Myth 4: "Bug bounties allow any testing"
**Reality**: Most bug bounty programs explicitly prohibit DoS/DDoS testing. Read the terms!

### Myth 5: "I'm just learning, I won't get caught"
**Reality**: Prosecutions of minors and students are common. Age is not a defense.

### Myth 6: "It's a public website, so it's fair game"
**Reality**: Public access ≠ permission to attack. Unauthorized testing is always illegal.
