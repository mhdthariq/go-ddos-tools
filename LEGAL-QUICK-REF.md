Before executing ANY attack, ask yourself:

1. Do I have written permission? (5 seconds)
2. Is this within authorized scope? (5 seconds)
3. Could this harm someone? (5 seconds)
4. Is this legal in my jurisdiction? (5 seconds)
5. Would I be comfortable explaining this to a judge? (5 seconds)

**If ANY answer is "no" or "unsure" - STOP.**
